A simple [TMSP application](github.com/tendermint/tmsp) serving a [merkle-tree key-value store](github.com/tendermint/go-merkle) 


```
writing down, my checksum
waiting for the, data to come
no need to pray for integrity
thats cuz I use, a merkle tree

grab the root, with a quick hash run
if the hash works out,
it must have been done

theres no need, for trust to arise
thanks to the crypto
now that I can merkleyes

take that data, merklize
ye, I merklize ...

then the truth, begins to shine
the inverse of a hash, you will never find
and as I watch, the dataset grow
producing a proof, is never slow

Where do I find, the will to hash
How do I teach it?
It doesn't pay in cash
Bitcoin, here, I've realized
Thats what I need now,
cuz real currencies merklize
